# PyED

PyED is an emacs like editor implemented entirely in Python

PyED project started in order to evaluate the Python language and its
ecosystem. PyED follows closely the Emacs style of editor
implementation with a command loop, buffer, point, mark, windows,
commands, modes and keymaps.

## Installing

The installation follows the standard Python guideline with a
`setup.py` script. So running:

    sudo python setup.py install

should do the trick.

 ## Using the editor

Start the editor with the `pyed` command. To quit the editor, press
'C-c' (i.e control key and 'c').
